# Show Your Work!

## Zoom
If you are on a Zoom with your MB Counselor, please ask if you can share your screen to show your code.

## Google Classroom
If you are working through the google classroom, please:
1. Select (highlight) all of the code in the window to the right.
2. Right-click on the highlighted text and select "Copy" (or press ctrl+c to copy without using the mouse)
3. On your computer, next to the start button, press "notepad"  (on a Mac, press command+space and type textedit).
4. In the window that opens up, right click and select "Paste" (or press ctrl+v)
5. On the File menu, select "Save" and give the file a name.  I suggest you save it as index.html and beprepared.js
6. In a separate tab, upload the file you just saved to your Google Classroom under Requirement 5.  

## Email
If you are working with your counselor via email, follow the instructions above for Google Classroom to save the files, and then attach those files to an email to your counselor.  Please make sure to include another adult leader such as your Scoutmaster on any email communication with your MB Counselor.

## School Chromebooks
Some scouts do this work from a School-issued chromebook that does not allow them to communicate outside.  Feel free to take a picture of the screen from a phone and email it to your MB Counselor from the phone.
