Now it is your turn.  You can change the code in any way you like.  Here are some ideas from Scout Life's resources that you might try:
1. Change the temperatures used in the decisions – change the lower temperature from 60 to 30 degrees, for example. Make sure you change it in two places! Save the file and refresh the browser (or restart the web page), and enter new numbers – did the answers change at the new temperature?
2. Create a new temperature range from 30 to 60 degrees and have it display – “Bring hat and gloves!”
3. Change the wording of the phrases.
4. Add another text input – ask for the wind speed, for example.
5. Add some conditional statements that evaluate the wind chill factor.
6. Add some text to display the wind chill result.

Take 15 minutes and see how many of these modications you can do, or get creative and make a different change to thecode.
