Copy the following code to the editor on the right:

<pre class="file" data-filename="index.html" data-target="replace">
<code class="language-html hljs">
<HTML>
<BODY>
    <H1>Hello, World</H1>
</BODY>
</HTML>
</code>
</pre>

You can change the message inside the H1 tag if you'd like.

Before we go any further, let's make sure this is working:

https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8080-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

Go ahead and change the message a few times.  This is the most basic of HTML files.
