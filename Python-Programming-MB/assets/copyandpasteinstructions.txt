This is the window where you will be doing your work.

At any time, you can select all of the text in this window, copy it to the clipboard, and save it to your local computer.  Here's how.

1. Select (highlight) all of the text in this window.
2. Right-click on the highlighted text and select "Copy" (or press ctrl+c to copy without using the mouse)
3. On your computer, next to the start button, press "notepad"  (on a Mac, press command+space and type textedit).
4. In the window that opens up, right click and select "Paste" (or press ctrl+v)
5. On the File menu, select "Save" and give the file a name (copyandpasteinsructions.txt works well for this one, but my-python-program.py works for the actual code you'll be working on) 

If you ever need to come back to where you were, you'll need to follow these steps:
1. Open Notepad on your computer
2. File->Open and find the file that you saved previously
3. Select all of the text
4. Right-click on the highlighted and select "Copy"
5. Navigate to where you were in the katacoda and press Save.  

You'll need to email your merit badge counselor the code when you are finished, so you'll need to copy/paste the code from the katacoda environment in order to send it.
