#What does the code do?

Let's start at the top.  There's a line starting with a pound (hash) and an exclamation point (bang).  Together, these are called a "shebang" and the "/usr/bin/env/python3" after the shebang tell the computer that this is code to be run in Python 3.

Then, you'll see some text that starts with the hash symbol, these are comments:
<pre>
<code class="language-python">
# From Scout Life Magazine....
</code>
</pre>

Comments do not get executed, but they are important because they communicate the meaning of the code to the next developer who reads this code.  You can change anything in green after a # symbol and it won't change the program.
