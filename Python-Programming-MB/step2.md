# Who is ready to see some code?

Here are some things you'll see in this tutorial.
1. Open `temperature.py`{{open}} -- This type of link opens a file.
2. Run `cd /code`{{execute}} to switch to the right working directory.  Commands that look like `cd /code`{{execute}} execute in the bottom half of your screen, and can be either typed, or clicked for automatic execution.
3. Run `python temperature.py`{{execute}}
