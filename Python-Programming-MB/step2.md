# Who is ready to see some code?

Here are some things you'll see in this tutorial.
1. Open `temperature.py`{{open}} -- This type of link opens a file.
2. Run `cd /code`{{execute}} to switch to the right working directory.  Commands that look like `cd /code`{{execute}} execute in the bottom half of your screen, and can be either typed, or clicked for automatic execution.
3. Run `python temperature.py`{{execute}}

In the bottom half of the screen, you'll see some things happening in the "Your Interactive Bash Terminal" portion of the screen.
It should say:
<pre>
Enter next temperature in degrees Farenheight (F)
</pre>

Go ahead and type in a number and see the result!

Once you get the result, you'll be asked
<pre>
Input another?
</pre>

If you type a "y", you'll be able to do the calculation again.

When you are done, press "n" to exit the program and press the "Continue" button below.
