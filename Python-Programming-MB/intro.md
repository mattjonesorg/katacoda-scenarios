In this Katacoda, you'll be introduced to Python for the Scouts BSA Programming Merit Badge.  Specifically, we will work on Requirement 5a, 5b, or 5c.  5a states:
>With your counselor's approval, choose a sample program.  Then, as a minimum, modify the code or add a function or subprogram to it.  Debug and demonstrate the modified program to your counselor.

Requirements 5b and 5c are similar, just with different programming languages.
