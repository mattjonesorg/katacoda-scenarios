Katacoda provides a temporary coding environment so you don't have to install lots of software on your home computer.  Because this is temporary, you must know that if you refresh this browser tab, all your work will be lost and you will start over at the beginning.  Do not refresh your browser.

And if you ever need to step away from the computer, for a bathroom break, or other, please copy and paste the contents of the file to your local computer.  

Open `copyandpasteinstructions.txt`{{open}} 

Follow the instructions you see on the right to practice saving your work.
