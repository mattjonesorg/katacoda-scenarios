# Show Your Work!

## Zoom
If you are on a Zoom with your MB Counselor, please ask if you can share your screen to show your code.

## Google Classroom
If you are working through the google classroom, please:
1. Select (highlight) all of the code in the window to the right.
2. Right-click on the highlighted text and select "Copy" (or press ctrl+c to copy without using the mouse)
3. On your computer, next to the start button, press "notepad"  (on a Mac, press command+space and type textedit).
4. In the window that opens up, right click and select "Paste" (or press ctrl+v)
5. On the File menu, select "Save" and give the file a name.  I suggest your name followed by the language, e.g. MattJonesPython.py
6. In a separate tab, upload the file you just saved to your Google Classroom under Requirement 5.
