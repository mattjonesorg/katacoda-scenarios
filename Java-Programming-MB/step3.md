# Tour of the Java code

Now, select the Editor tab.

The first thing to note is that this is a program that is composed of 4 different Java files.  Other languages let you do this also, but it's pretty important in Object Oriented languages like Java.

First, let's look at `src/main/java/org/troop618oaklawn/GuessAWord.java`{{open}}

On line 7, you'll see that this has a function called main().  All Java programs have this function, and that's where the program begins.

Line 9 declares a Scanner object that allows the user to input some text.

And on line 11, we see a Game object being created.  We'll come back to that on the next step.

And line 14 starts a loop where we ask the user if they want to play again.
