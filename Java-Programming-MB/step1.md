# Getting the code

Most software engineers use a source control system to manage the code for the applications they develop.  Today, we'll use the most common source control system "git" to fetch the source code we will work with.

Run `git clone https://github.com/mattjonesorg/java-guess-a-word.git`{{execute}} to fetch the code.  Github is a site where there are millions of projects that developers have made their source code available.

Open the file `java-guess-a-word/LICENSE`{{open}} and you'll see the license I have used to make this source code available.  

Because I wrote this software, I own the license to the application, and I am choosing to make this available to everybody free of charge.  The only condition of the license is that this license and copyright notice be included in any copies of the software.

Next, open the folder `java-guess-a-word/`{{open}}
