# Running the program

Java is a static compiled language, while Javascript and Python are intepreted languages that both compile and run the code at the same time.

With Java, we have to run a command in order to create a program that the computer can run.  Do that using the following command:

`mvn clean compile package`{{execute}}

Mvn (Maven) is a program we use to help with the build steps in Java.

If there are no errors, you should be ready to run the program with the following command:

`mvn exec:java`{{execute}}

Anytime you need to make a change to the program, you'll need to run these commands in order to see your changes in action.

See if you can guess the word?  

Are there any problems with the code?
